And the pandemic was not a hurdle in the way. The members organise various activities such as quiz competition, essay writing, paper presentation etc. to enhance the said skills. Previously, the club had also organised some illuminating seminars and webinars by some renowned speakers who not only engaged with students but also imparted their valuable knowledge. EWS Club gives students a chance to take part in any activity irrespective of their field of study. The club plans to increase the seminars in the upcoming semester and this time students will also get to present their sessions."
